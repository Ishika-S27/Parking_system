🚗 Parking Space Prediction using Machine Learning
📖 Project Overview

The Smart Parking Prediction System aims to forecast the availability of parking spaces using machine learning techniques.
Instead of relying on physical IoT sensors, it uses historical and time-based data to predict whether parking bays are likely to be free or occupied at specific times.
This approach supports smart city initiatives by optimizing parking management and reducing traffic congestion.
