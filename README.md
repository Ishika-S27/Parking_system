> ### 🧩 **Overview**  
> The **Parking Space Prediction System** aims to analyze and forecast parking availability using **machine learning algorithms**.  
> Instead of relying on costly IoT-based sensors, this project uses **historical parking and time data** to predict whether a space will be **occupied or free**.  
> The model helps in improving **traffic flow**, reducing **driver frustration**, and supporting **smart city initiatives**.

> ### 🎯 **Project Goal**  
> The goal of this project is to **predict the availability of parking spaces** with high accuracy using **data-driven approaches**.  
> By studying patterns from **previous parking data**, it helps users find available spots more efficiently, ultimately saving **time and fuel**.

> ### ⚙️ **Technology Stack**  
> - **Programming Language:** Python  
> - **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
> - **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier  
> - **Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn for insights and trend analysis  

> ### 📊 **Key Features**  
> - **Data Preprocessing** — cleaning and organizing raw data for analysis  
> - **Feature Engineering** — extracting useful time-based features  
> - **Model Training & Evaluation** — building and testing prediction models  
> - **Visualization** — graphical representation of parking trends and predictions  

> ### 📈 **Results**  
> The model successfully predicts **parking space availability** across various time intervals.  
> It identifies **peak demand hours** and **highly occupied zones**, enabling better **parking management** and **traffic control**.

> ### 🧠 **Future Scope**  
> - Integration with **real-time sensor or GPS data**  
> - Deployment as a **web or mobile application** for live updates  
> - Extension using **deep learning** for improved accuracy and dynamic predictions
